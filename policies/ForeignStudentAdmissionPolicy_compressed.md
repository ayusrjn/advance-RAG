## Number of seats:

As per UGC guidelines, Foreign Nationals will be admitted over and above the approved intake in a course up to a maximum of 15% of the approved intake in the eligible courses, depending upon the availability of adequate infrastructure. All the available seats may not be filled in a particular year if a subject's Admission Committee does not recommend anyone or if a program has inadequate infrastructure. Foreign nationals seeking admission through ICCR or other governmental agencies may apply to the University in the prescribed form through the respective bodies.

The University may consider the admission of foreign nationals, "in absentia", based on their desire"to be considered in absentia". Their admission under the 15% bracket for International students, to any programme is subject to the condition that they are found suitable for admission by the Admissions Committee of the Centre/Department/School.

## Academic qualification:

A prospective Foreign National has to fulfill the eligibility conditions, including the required qualifying degree and marks/grades, as prescribed for Indian students. These conditions can website befound in theprospectus which is available on theUniversity (www.uohyd.ac.in or http://acad.uohyd.ac.in).In case a student's parent University does not have a program that is prescribed as minimum eligibility condition, the equivalent program may be considered. In this respect the Admission Committee's decision is final.

NRI's with Indian Passport are Indian Nationals and therefore, cannot be considered as International Students.
