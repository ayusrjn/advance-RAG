## 1.Preamble

- University of Hyderabad (UoH) is committed to develop as a leading public institution in research by proactively furthering a culture of research,among faculty,research scholars, academic associates, scientists, and students. This commitment to furthering research will draw on the vast cxpericnce in doctoral and post-graduate education, providing opportunities to cnhance its reputation, globally, among leading researchers and institutions.
- Further, the University will encourage researchers to apply the paradigm of integrative research'.
- To support research activities,the University provides infrastructure,which includes use of academic mentoring, technological tools, stipend to all doctoral scholars, and linkages to broader society. A very large library of published work, much of which appearing in reputed journals,books,as well as in the form of diverse outputs, form the fulcrum of research activities at the University.
- Research at the University is envisioned to proceed through autonomy and academic freedom to all researchers.Ensuring integrity of the research process, output is of utmost importance to the University. To this end, the University has developed policies on research ethics and accountability through transparency, along with guidelines on social responsibility.

integration of rescarch results across different temporal and spatial scalesbetween different schools of thought, and between empirical and theoretical approaches (Newell et. a. 2005). This is to emphasize the process of conceptual thinking.

The University recognizes that research scholarship outputs are wide ranging, besides bibliometric indicator. The University recognizes that through research activities the faculty, students and all others involved are scientific and cultural agents of change and excellence.

## 2.ScopeofResearchEndeavours

Ourresearchendeavourswill be:

- To promote integrative research at the scale ofregion'and link the work to local or micro-level and global perspectives.

<!-- image -->

- As a publicUniversity,we believe that value of knowledge acquired through research is not only in terms of quality,but also in increasing its societal relevance.This is achieved by sharing our expertise andinfrastructuralresources.
- TheUniversityhas over the years installed high-end andworld-classfacilities togenerate and useknowledge.However,ourbelief thatgrowthof knowledge strength ismanifoldwhen the infrastructure is made widely accessible to researchers and other potential users outside of the University.This waywe aspire toreduce potential inequality that arises due to weakness in access and use of knowledge. Furthermore,we hope to accelerate and expand on the rangeofproblems thatmaybeaddressed throughresearch.
- An added advantage to researchers at the University will be,to strengthen networks of knowledge sharing. These include resources such as collections, archives and data- and bio-banks at physical sciences, engineering, life sciences, social sciences, humanities or related departments and schools.
- Apart from strengthening research activities, there are modest financial benefits to be accrued by theUniversity.

## 10.Policies and Facets of theUniversity Research Practices

The University encourages cquitable access to all resources and promotes best practices byfollowing ethical practices and complyingwithregulatory standards.TheUniversity provides to all a stable institutional environment,which is conduciveforresearch.Weview learning about research as a skill,which can be improved upon throughout one's career.

## ForFaculty

## 13.From Knowledge for its own sake to use of Knowledge

- UoH has placed several initiatives to surmount barriers that were limiting easy access to research output, outside of the scientific domain.That is to say,nature of valorisationis 2 shaping academic research at the University.
- Thus far, practical relevance of research work undertaken at the University has been predominantly noted in terms of patenting, licensing, spin-off formation, and technology transfer. All these cconomic outcomes of university research have been widely acknowledged. In the arena of life sciences, health sciences,and such, the idea of translational research has been promoted to enhance the value ofresearch conducted in laboratories by identifying practical use or applications of that knowledge. University has necessary infrastructure (incubation centres) andmechanisms(TechnologyIndustrial Liaison

2Valorisation cncompasses all activities that contribute to ensuring that the outcomes of scientific knowledge add value beyond the scientifie-domain (Benneworth and Jongbloed 2010).

Entrepreneurship Unit,TIE-U) to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the University campus.

- In the subjects of social sciences and humanities, knowledge being converted into practical use or action manifests in the form of lending their expertise and knowledge in expert panels, commissions, as board members ofnon-governmental organizations,member in regulatory bodies, inquiry commission, editorial board of peer-reviewed journals, keynote speakers, besides developing monographs, plays, sculptures, paintings, performances such as dance andmusic.
- University recognises the role of researchers in the public affairs of the nation.
- Faculty members and researchers will be allowed to be part of committees constituted at international/ national/ state levels on public interest issues. The admissible leave will be provided to faculty members to discharge such duties.
- Despite thesevaried manifestations of use of knowledge from humanities and social science for public, there continues a conundrum of developing an entire spectrum of ways in which this knowledge can be put to effective use, besides being ripe with ethical and moral issues.
- However, the University seeks to further reduce the prevailing gap between research work undertaken at the University and use of that knowledge in decision-making,or as a'public good', or in implementing solutions. The university is therefore committed to strengthen efficacy of variousmodels that integrates research with public good.
- promote research at the University.
