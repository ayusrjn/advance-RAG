## Information Technology Policy for Computing, Communication and Social Media

## PURPOSE

The University of Hyderabad recognizes the vital role Information Technology plays in the University's missions and related administrative activities as well as the importance in an academic environment of protecting information in all forms. As more informationisused andsharedinadigital formatbystudents,faculty andstaff,bothwithin and outside the University,an increased effort must be made to protect the information and the technology resources that support it.Increased protection of our Computer and Communication resources to assure the usability and availability of those resources is the primary purpose of this policy. The ethical principles that apply to everyday community life also apply to computing and communications. Every user of University of Hyderabad has two basic rights: privacy and a fair share of resources. It is unethical for any other person to violate these rights.

The Policy lays down general guidelines for the use of computing and communication resources.We cannot enumerate all these cases.However,a thumb rule is that any activity which inconveniences users, depletes the computer center resources,or jeopardizes thesecurity of the systems,orviolatesintellectual property rightsofsoftware, amounts to unethical use.Moreover,it should be noted that the punishment set out for various cases can change and can be very severe depending on the view that the University takes of the offence.Faculty,staff,and students with authorized accounts may use theIT facilities for academic purposes,official university business,and forpersonal purposes so long as such use doesnotviolate any law,University IT policy or IT act of the Government of India.

## SCOPE

- People to Whom Policy Applies: This Policy applies to everyone who accesses University Information Technology Resources, whether affiliated with the University or not,whether on campus or from remote locations,including but not limited to students,faculty,staff, contractors,consultants, temporary mployees,guests,and volunteers. By accessing University Information Technology Resources, the user agrees to comply with this Policy.
- Definition of Information Technology Resources: Information Technology Resources for purposes of this Policy include,but are not limited to,University-owned internet transmission lines,networks,wireless networks,servers,exchanges,i connections,terminals,applications, servers and personal computers.Information Technology Resources include those owned by the University and those used by the University under license or contract, including but not limited to information recorded on all types of electronic media, computer hardware and software, paper, computer networks, and telephone systems. Information Technology Resources also includes, but is not limited to, personal computers, servers, wireless networks and other devices not owned by the University but intentionally connected to the University-owned Information Technology Resources (other than temporary legitimate access via the worldwideweb access)while so connected.
- Policy change: As and when it is considered appropriate and new policies or the changes in policy will take effect immediately after a brief announcement by any means, e-mail, printed notices, or through the news groups.

## PRIVACY

- On shared computer systems [like servers, HPC systems etc.] every user is assigned an ID.Nobody else should use an ID without explicit permission from the owner.
- All files belong to somebody. They should be assumed to be private and confidential unless the ownerhas explicitlymade them available to others.
- Messages sent to other users should always identify the sender.
- Networktrafficboth on Intranet/Internetis implicitlyprivate.
- Records, including logs relating to the use of computing and information resources are confidential.

## A.Computing

## 1.Resources

- i. Nobody should deliberately attempt to degrade or disrupt computing and communication systems performance or to interfere with the work of others. Any attempt to disrupt service or performance on systems on or off campus can result in the loss of network privileges and disciplinary action. The following items are all examples of denial of service attacks,but are not completelyinclusive:
2. Mail bombing (sending thousands of mail messages to a group or individual)
3. Ping flooding (launching continuous ping requests at a specific machine
4. "Smurfattacks"
5. "SYN flooding"
- i. Loopholes in computer systems or knowledge of a special password should not be used to alter computer systems, obtain extra resources, or take resources from another person. [Reframing of Sentence required].
- ili. Computing equipment owned by academic/administrative units or individuals should be used onlywith the owner'spermission.
- iv. University resources are provided for university purposes. Any use of computing for commercial purposes or personal financial gain must be authorized in advance. While the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of education and research,it realizes the need to encourage the personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community.The extent to which these resources are used for personal reasons is limited to strictly non-profitoriented tasks. Thus, it is reasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document preparation or other activity that can facilitate convenience or enhance productivity. Any personal use of computing resources that produces individual financial gain is prohibited unless permission has been taken and an account has been issued which releases this restriction.
9. v.It is unethical to make so excessive a use of system resources [on Servers, HPC systems etc] that other users cannot obtain access to these resources. Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period of heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does not limit such utilization, and use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an environment of networked personal computers.A novice user might well be unaware that a particular type of action constitutes "excessive use"; but once a system unreasonable, that user is tobe held responsible for any further such infractions.
10. mutilation,and abuse of theseresourcesviolate the natureand spirit of community and intellectual inquiry.

## 2.SystemAdministration

- i. On rare occasions,computing staffmay access others'files,but onlywhen strictly necessary for the maintenance of a system.There may be technical reasons why a small number of system personnel must have access to all information on the system,much as custodial personnel must have keys to all offices in university buildings. Such persons bear a special responsibility not to abuse such privileges. It is improper for them to peruse a user's files for any purpose unrelated to their official functions or to appropriate or divulge any information which the user has protected fromgeneralpublicaccess.
2. i.If a loophole is found in the security of any computer system, it should be reported to the system administrator and not usedforpersonal gain or to disrupt thework ofothers.
- ili. Distribution of programs and databases is controlled by the laws of copyright, licensing agreements, and trade secret laws. These must be observed.

## 3.Security

- i. Users are responsible for the security and integrity of their systems.In cases where a computer is"hacked into",it is recommended that the system be either shut down any potential damage and to stop the attack from spreading. In such cases, if the system administrator cannot be contacted in a reasonable time, concerned authority reserves the right to disable the network connection.Once the system administratorismade aware of the situation and agreesto takereasonable stepsto ensure that themachine is not compromised,networkprivilegesmay berestored.
- i. In cases where, despite the efforts of the system administrator, the machine continues to pose a security concern,wereserve the right to require that the user switch to a single user Os before allowing the system back onto the campus network.
- ii. In cases where a user's machines habitually cause problems, by action, as a "target" ofincoming attacks,orbecause of alackofresponsiblebehavior on theowner's part, Computing Centre may initiate action to-permanently ban the user from havingmachineson the campusnetwork.

- 4.Anonymous Mailers:All electronic communications at University of Hyderabad must accurately identify the sender. Anonymous and masquerading mail forwarders are explicitly prohibited by the IT policy.
- 5.Copyright Material [Example Music/Movies Files]: It is a common misconception that the creation and subsequent distribution of music files is an acceptable activity. The distribution of copyright protected materials is illegal and is in direct violation of the Computing Code of Ethics. Movies which are protected by copyright law, and to which you do not have a license to distribute, should be treated with the same consideration as music files. Copyright material from any website using UoH resources is prohibited.
6. Obscenity material should NEVER be digitally stored, manipulated nor shared.
- 7.Software Piracy: Distributing licensed software is illegal and constitutes a violation of the Computing Code of Ethics.
- 8.Backup of critical data should be in compliance with the requirements of IT Act of India.

## B.Communications

## 1.General Guidelines:

- a.It should also be noted that university resources,such as the campus network, are provided for university purposes. Allowing unaffiliated users to have account on campus or dedicated remote access systems could be considered as a violation of this policy.
- b. Bulk emails communicated through G-Apps will be permitted after due approval of the competent authority.
- period of the dynamic lease to any device on the communication network.
- d. Under no circumstances may machines be configured with IP addresses that have not been assigned by Computer Centre/CNF. By using an unregistered IP address or an IP addressed to another,you may deprive other users of network service and/or make it considerably more difficult to diagnose network problems on the campus network.
- e. The servers which have public IP addresses issued to the concerned academic/administrative unit will be liable for any breach of security.
- f. Using a different Ethernet hardware address than is registered with Computer Centre will also result in the machine being removed from the network. Users purchasing new ethernet cards,or who otherwise need to change their hardware address must inform Computer Centre in order to ensure that theinformation listed above is kept accurate and up-to-date.

## 2.Routers

- a.Routers are generally used to connect multiple network segments together and should not be necessary for individual users on our campus.If misconfigured, routers can cause severe problems for all users on a network segment. Therefore, all the Wi-Fi AP/Routers are mandated to be configured by the Campus Network Facility.For these reasons, systems connected to the campus network at any site arenotpermitted to act asrouters.
- b. Most operating systems do not provide routing functionality and are perfectly safe to attach to our network in any configuration. Some operating systems such asWindows/POsIXMachines/Servershave the capability toproviderouting functionality;for these operating systems,you should ensure that routing isnot explicit permission is obtained in advance from CC/CNF.
3. Systems on the campus network are not permitted to be configured as DHCP servers. DHCP allows systems to obtain the correct IP address during the boot process. User owned DHCP servers may override the distribution of IP addresses by the official DHCP servers, causing the client system to obtain an incorrect address, denying it accesstothenetwork.
4. Domain Names: All registered machines being used for website hosting or for any research activity on the UoH/External network using the domain"uohyd.ac.in",must have the security compliance in place or given access through VPN.
5. Network Traffic: Network traffic should be considered private. Because of this, any "packet sniffing", or other deliberate attempts to read network information which is not intended foryour use will be grounds for loss of network privilegesfor a period of not less than one full semester.In some cases, the loss of privileges may be permanent. Note that it is permissible to run a packet sniffer explicitly configured in nonpromiscuous mode (you may snif packets going to orfrom your machine). This allows users to explore aspects ofnetworkingwhileprotecting theprixacy of others.
- 6.Buildings on the Campus and dedicated remote access service connections to the campus network, and to the Internet, are provided to allow students, staff and faculty tofully participatein the teaching,research and administrative activities of University inventive content to the Internet community,so long as it remainsfeasible forus to do SO.
- 7.It may not remain feasible to provide unlimited connectivity for systems which arenot strictly serving the University's missions.Because of this possibility,we reserve the right torequest that users reduce the amount of traffic being caused by their service,or where necessary, to remove such systems or services from the campus network. In all but extreme cases,we will contact the owner of the system beforeremoving it from the network.
- 8.Misconfigured Services: There may be times when a machine is unintentionally misconfigured and subsequently causes a problem on the campus network.In such machine will be disconnected from the campus network immediately.The owner of the system in such cases will be notified via electronic mail and via telephone that the machine hasbeen disconnected.
9. The machine will only be allowed back onto the network after the owner notifies Competent Authority or the person who sent the electronic mail, that they have reconfigured the machine,resolving theproblem.
- 10.Network Maintenance: Computer Centre will periodically conduct scans of various areas of the network (subnets) in order to help to maintain a reasonable network environment for the majority of our users. Results of such scanning would help to discover misconfigured systems and may in some cases cause us to discover activity which violates laws, University policies or guidelines. In such cases, action appropriate to the "problem"will be taken.
